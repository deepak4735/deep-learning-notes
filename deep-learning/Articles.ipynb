    "> To test our method, we tried to find a way to attack it. Our idea is to search for pairs of latent codes z,zâ€™ that produce images that are nearby but classified very differently. By solving a min-max problem we obtained several such natural adversarial examples.\n",

    "> The method of adversarial training, proposed by Goodfellow et al., provides a way to convert any attack into a defense. Generate adversarial examples using the attack method, associate them with the correct labels and add to the dataset as new training examples. It was recently shown that adversarial training can be seen as a form of robust optimization (as shown by Madry et al. and Shaham et al. ). Adversarial training seems to be one of the very few methods that withstands attacks, like the recent attack  to ICLR defenses.\n",
